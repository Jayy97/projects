This is a simple calculator app built using:
HTML/CSS/Javascript

It works simply by using an onclick function for each button to display to the 
display div. The operators are then stored as their mathematical equivalence
and I have simply used the eval() function onclick of the = button which then
evaluates the equation that is displayed in the display div.

Colour scheme based off the apple calculator

Fun little project
